# PPA-MAJOR

A group coursework. The Game Panel was created from scratch by me and also the window system itself.
It uses the JOGL library for the Game Panel so OpenGL can be used in Java Swing. Also the caching of
the UFO data was designed by me, to create the most optimal experience for the users. However the server
isn't up anymore so this cannot be tested and will most likely throw an error.
